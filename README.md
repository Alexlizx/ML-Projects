* [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/tasks?taskId=72): The purpose of this project is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is extremely unbalanced; the positive class (frauds) only accounts for
0.172% of all transactions.

* [Concrete Compressive Strength](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Concrete+Compressive+Strength): The purpose of this project is to predict concrete compressive strength. The dataset consists of 1030 instances with 9 attributes. The first seven features represent the amount of each raw material (measured in kg/mÂ³) and the eighth represents Age (in Days).
